IEC 60870-5-101 Server RTU Simulator

Complete Simulation of IEC 101 Server as per Protocol Standard including File transfer. Support Balanced and unbalanced modes.

Add up to 50 server node in the simulator. Every server node will work independently.

User can update the monitoring Point information and quality bits. Send all type of commands, parameter activation, file transfer.

Download Evaluation Kit - IEC 101 Development Bundle:

In the Development Bundle, We included IEC 101 Server & Client Simulator, Windows and Linux Software Development Kit.

http://www.freyrscada.com/iec-60870-5-101.php

you can test the simulator with IEC 101 Client Simulator.
and use the serial null modem emulator (https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/) for connecting IEC 101 server and client simulator via serial cable.
